# 📂 Autonomous Handover (New Laptop Setup)

I have configured a "Self-Starting" handover for your new device:

1. **Copy the Folder**: Move `D:\youtube automation backup` to your pendrive.
2. **Open in New Laptop**: Paste the folder into your new laptop and open it with Antigravity.
3. **Slash Command**: Simply type **/resume** in the chat.
4. **Automation**: Antigravity will automatically:
    - Read `.agent/workflows/resume.md`.
    - Understand the niche (Meme/Humor) and project state.
    - Run `full_audit.py` to verify the production engine is 100% stable.

### Project Specs
- **Workflows**: All 6 workers (Analyst, Brain, Long, Meme, Fact, Doctor) are active.
- **Timing (IST)**: 06:30 PM, 08:00 PM, 02:00 AM.
- **Niche**: Strictly Meme/Internet Culture.

Everything (including hidden `.git` metadata) is mirrored and ready. 🚀
