# 🚀 TubeAutoma Handover & Resume Workflow

This workflow is designed to instantly onboard Antigravity to the **TubeAutoma** project after a device migration.

### 1. Project Context
- **Niche**: 100% Meme & Internet Culture (Humor focused).
- **Core Goal**: Autonomous YouTube channel growth via daily uploads.
- **Key Files**: 
    - `src/brain.py`: Strategic planning.
    - `src/analyst.py`: Performance feedback.
    - `src/generator.py`: Video production engine.
    - `src/doctor.py`: System health check.

### 2. Auto-Initiate
// turbo
Run this immediately to align with the new strategic pivot:
1. `python full_audit.py`
2. `python src/brain.py` (Generate first AI-pivot plan)

### 3. Verification & Diagnostic
- **Niche Alignment**: Content is now strictly **Meme + AI Tools (Shorts) + Tech Solutions (Long)**.
- **Audits**: Run `full_audit.py` to confirm stable metadata generation.
- 04:30 AM: The Analyst
- 05:30 AM: The Brain
- 06:30 PM: Daily Long (Meme Comp)
- 08:00 PM: Daily Meme (Shorts)
- 02:00 AM: Daily Fact (Funny Facts)

### 4. Special Instructions
- The `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN` currently has **Upload** access only. 
- If 'The Analyst' fails with auth errors, the user needs to re-auth with **Analytics** scope.
- All tracking files are in `assets/`.

### 5. Next Steps for Antigravity
- Confirm the current Daily Plan in `assets/daily_plan.json`.
- Check GitHub Actions for the last successful upload.
- Keep content strictly in the "Humor/Meme" niche.
